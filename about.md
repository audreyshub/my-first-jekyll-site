I'm a dreamer, creative and explorer who made the leap and left a career at top tech companies to pursue a deep yearning for a life of self-designed work, play, and travel.

>Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? - Mary Oliver

Designing a website is a lot like painting. A little intimidating at first wondering if it'll turn out well. You build each section, div by div, element by element, each feature one task at a time. There are times when you hate the process or doubt that you're even good but you persist. Changing fonts, color, pixels, padding, backgrounds, images, writing code one line at a time like laying down brush strokes. You step away to get perspective but get drawn back to it again and again. Yes, it may be just code but if you do it right, a big piece of your heart and soul slips into each website you build.
